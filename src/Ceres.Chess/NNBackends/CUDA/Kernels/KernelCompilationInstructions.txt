Instructions to genrerate kernels (PTX from CU).
Needs 4 files from LC0 project 
  cuda_common.h
  winograd_helper.inc
  fp16_kernels.cu
  common_kernels.cu
NOTE: The above .cu files were trivially modified in one way: 
      all arguments accepting a stream were removed (sometimes also a template argument of 0).
Also one small file from Ceres
  ceres_kernels.cu

Steps:
  1. Pull LC0 code from the LC0 project (and make the above referenced trivial changes).
  2. Create utils subdirectory under C:\dev\lc0\master1\lc0\src\neural\cuda and copy the LC0 utils source code files there (so CUDA compiler will find)
  3. Launch a console session from menu bar using "x64 Native Tools  Command Propmt for Visual Studio 2019"
  4. Change into directory where CU files are located
  5. Run the 3 commands to generate PTX and then copy to source code tree (update directory as needed).
  6. Also generate the extra file fp16_kernels_big.ptx using instruction below.
  7. Rebuild C# project and test.

My working directory was: C:\dev\lc0\master1\lc0\src\neural\cuda.

NOTE: Initially "-arch=sm_70" was used but failed to run on 1080 GPUs. 
      Then switched to "-arch=sm_60" with no apparent loss of performance. But 1080 GPU does not work well (slow FP16).
      So switch back to "-arch=sm_70"

Batch file (go.cmd):
"C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.1\bin\nvcc.EXE" -ptx -o common_kernels.ptx  -c common_kernels.cu -arch=sm_70
"C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.1\bin\nvcc.EXE" -ptx -o fp16_kernels.ptx  -c fp16_kernels.cu -arch=sm_70
"C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.1\bin\nvcc.EXE" -ptx -o ceres_kernels.ptx  -c ceres_kernels.cu -arch=sm_70

copy common_kernels.ptx C:\dev\Ceres\src\Ceres.Chess\NNBackends\CUDA\Kernels\PTX
copy fp16_kernels.ptx C:\dev\Ceres\src\Ceres.Chess\NNBackends\CUDA\Kernels\PTX
copy ceres_kernels.ptx C:\dev\Ceres\src\Ceres.Chess\NNBackends\CUDA\Kernels\PTX

rem TODO: someday maybe run for all possible kernels
rem nvcc -h
rem foreach x : ['sm_80', 'sm_75', 'sm_86', 'sm_70', 'sm_60' , 'sm_72', 'sm_62', 'sm_53']
rem         nvcc_extra_args += '-code=' + x

Other notes:
  - it may be necessary to use "-allow-unsupported-compiler" at the end of the nvcc command lines
  - setting the Visual Studio pathing can also be done by running the vcvars64.bat/vcvars64.cmd batch file provided by Microsoft
  - a version "fp16_kernels_big.ptx" was made by changing the following (to 512) in cuda_common.h
    (this PTX is auto-selected if C > 384)
      static constexpr int kMaxSupportedChannelsForResBlockFusing      = 384;  // limit on num_filters
